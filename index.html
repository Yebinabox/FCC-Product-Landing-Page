    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This text is going to be replaced once the website is completed. You are currently reading some filler text. This is just dummy text that is essentially a placeholder so you can see what your final typefaces will look like. At some point someone will replace this block of text with useful words so visitors can learn more about your services/products offered by the website!</p>
    <p>It is useful for web designers to use placeholder text so they can easily see what different fonts look like on a realistic paragraph. Placeholder text is useful when you need to see what a page design looks like, but the actual content isn't available. It's like having someone with identical measurements check the fit of a dress before trying it on yourself.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="3">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This text is not final and should be replaced. This is placeholder text that our web designers put here to make sure words appear properly on your website. If the designer had some useful text to place here, this is how the typeface would appear. Eventually, text related to your business, services or products will replace this content.</p>
    <p>This line was intentionally left blank. You are currently reading some filler text. There needs to be something here, even though it's not what you might expect on a finished website. This line was intentionally left blank. When the final copy for the site has been created, it will go here.</p>
